f1-f4 are the result files I got from the 4 equations.
For f1, False-Position gets the most iterations to find the root. And all the methods work fine.
For f2, Bisection gets the most iterations to find the root. And only Bisection doesn't work fine.
For f3, Bisection gets the most iterations to find the root. And Bisection doesn't work fine.
For f4, Mullers gets the most iterations to find the root. And Mullter doesn't work fine.
